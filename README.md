# README

This is a sample repository that outlines potential layout for a team monorepo.

## Workflows

Not much here, this is a primarily-terraform repo. Should just run plan/apply. Workflows pertaining to Kestra and Temporal will be external to this repo as they are not owned solely by the team nor directly maintained.
